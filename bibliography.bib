    abstract = "This paper develops a new method for intensity image segmentation. A neural network of non-linear analog neurons has been shown extremely effective. This problem is considered as an optimally classification of an image based on their original activation. Optimization is defined in terms of energy which is a function of neurons whose output values may vary continuously. The neurons are modelled as amplifiers which have sigmoid monotonic input-output relations. A synapse between two neurons is defined by a conductance which connects the output of a neuron to the input of another neuron. In the experiments, we show that our method is effective even if the images are corrupted with heavy Gaussian noise."

    % abstract = { Most people have great difficulty in recalling unrelated items. For example, in free recall experiments, lists of more than a few randomly selected words cannot be accurately repeated. Here we introduce a phenomenological model of memory retrieval inspired by theories of neuronal population coding of information. The model predicts nontrivial scaling behaviors for the mean and standard deviation of the number of recalled words for lists of increasing length. Our results suggest that associative information retrieval is a dominating factor that limits the number of recalled items.}
