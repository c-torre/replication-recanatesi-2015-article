Replication of Recanatesi et al. (2015) "Neural Network Model of Memory Retrieval"
==================================================================================

Replication authors: [Carlos de la Torre-Ortiz](https://github.com/c-torre) and [Aur√©lien Nioche](https://github.com/AurelienNioche/).

Original article: S. Recanatesi, M. Katkov, S. Romani, M. Tsodyks, Neural Network Model of Memory Retrieval, Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience. 9 (2015) 149. [doi:10.3389/fncom.2015.00149](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2015.00149).

Recanatesi *et al.* present a model of memory retrieval based on a Hopfield model for associative learning, with network dynamics that reflect associations between items due to semantic similarities.

This repository contains the source of the [Rescience C](https://rescience.github.io/) article, based on their Overleaf [template](https://github.com/rescience/template).
