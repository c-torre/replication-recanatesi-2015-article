\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we successfully reproduced the results of the memory model simulation reported by \cite{recanatesi2015}.
This was possible by modifying the equations of the original article.
Changes scale parameters or modify their base values to correct the errors in the original manuscript in coordination with the original authors.
As in the reference research, we show that oscillating inhibition, together with noise and item contiguity, induce the transition of recall of different memories in a Hopfield model of memory retrieval.
